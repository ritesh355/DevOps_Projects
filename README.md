# 🚀 DevOps Projects – Complete Portfolio

Welcome to my DevOps Projects Portfolio, a curated collection of all the real-world DevOps, Cloud, CI/CD, Automation, and Infrastructure projects I have built.
This repository is continuously updated as I learn new tools, build more systems, and explore advanced DevOps concepts.

Each project is stored in its own folder with documentation, source code, architecture diagrams, and deployment steps.

### 📌 Repository Overview

- This repo contains projects covering:

- Docker & Containerization

- CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, AWS CodePipeline)

- AWS Cloud (S3, EC2, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudFront, IAM, CodeBuild)

- Monitoring & Observability

- DevSecOps (Trivy, security scanning)

- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

- Serverless Architecture

- Microservices

- Full-stack DevOps automation

- Git, Bash scripting, Cloud Networking, and more.
